#Laravel

Laravel is an open source PHP framework that aims to make development pleasing with MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

This time, I get a task asked to follow Laravel Bootcamp for the first exposure to Laravel through this website: (https://bootcamp.laravel.com/)

1. Installation
2. Creating Chirps
3. Showing Chirps
4. Editing Chirps
5. Deleting Chirps
6. Notifications & Events
