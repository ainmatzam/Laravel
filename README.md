#Laravel

Laravel is an open source PHP framework that aims to make development pleasing with MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

This time, I get a task from NBS to follow Laravel Bootcamp for the first exposure to Laravel through: (https://bootcamp.laravel.com/)
In this bootcamp, it provide a walkthrough to build a modern Laravel application from scratch. Therefore, in order to explore test the framework, a microblogging platform called Chirper was build.

In Chirper, users are able to add short messages (chirp), edit and delete their own chirps on the blog. Aside from that, this bootcamp included an email notification where when one user chirp, the other users will get the email via MailHog.
